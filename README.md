ðŸ“Œ Overview
Developed an interactive console-based Java application named Truck Loader, designed to manage and organize cargo box data for transport logistics. The program allows users to input, store, and retrieve information about boxes being loaded into a truck, including customer names, box weights, and dangerous goods status.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Dynamic Data Entry:
Users can specify the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry. The program then collects data for each box, including:
Customer name
Box weight (in kg)
Whether the box contains dangerous goods (yes/no)
Data Storage:
Information is stored in three parallel arrays:
Customer Names (String array)
Weights (Double array)
Dangerous Goods Status (Boolean array â€” true for dangerous, false for non-dangerous)
Menu-Driven User Interface:
After data entry, the program offers users multiple options in a looped menu:
List all boxes with their details
Search boxes by customer name
Search boxes based on dangerous goods status
Quit the program with a farewell message
Efficient Data Handling:
Utilized boolean arrays for storing dangerous goods status to optimize memory and simplify conditional checks.

ðŸ“Œ Technical Highlights
Implemented input handling using Scanner
Utilized loops for iterative data collection and menu navigation
Applied conditional statements for decision-making based on user input
Practiced nesting loops and conditionals to manage complex menu-driven interactions
Gained experience in array management and dynamic data storage

ðŸ“Œ Outcome
Successfully built a functional, user-friendly program that demonstrates key programming fundamentals including variables, operators, conditionals, loops, arrays, and user interaction within a console-based application. This project enhanced my practical skills in Java development and problem-solving in dynamic environments.
